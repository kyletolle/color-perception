# Color Perception

A demo to show how it can be difficult to perceive change in color.
Supplement to my [Clouds blog post][1].

The page's background subtly changes from black to white. The transition is
slow enough that it's hard to determine exactly when the color change is
occurring, especially when it's nearest to being fully black and/or fully
white.

## Running

Load the `index.html` page in a browser, or visit the [live demo][2].
